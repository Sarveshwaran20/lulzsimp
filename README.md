developer, geek, feminist? people usually don't like me.
If you've ever met me in a competition, most probably I won.
I study pretty well. I usually work on ideas that I think potentially would change the world.
My work ethic, I guess, is pretty good if all teachers and people who come across my projects appreciate it.
I'm not a people person, but I love contributing any way I can, so lemme know if you want some help.
